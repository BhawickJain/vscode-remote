Hvaing jupyter notebooks with its various kernels is great. But what if you just want to run and debug a simple script? You'd need a code editor, sure, but exactly do you debug the code if it is inside a container? I deally I would like to be able to add breakpoint and do all the various debugging exercises I usually do. Enter VS Code Remote.
